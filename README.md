# literature_parser_backend

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m literature_parser_backend
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload and exposed ports add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "LITERATURE_PARSER_BACKEND_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "literature_parser_backend/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "LITERATURE_PARSER_BACKEND_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `literature_parser_backend.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
LITERATURE_PARSER_BACKEND_RELOAD="True"
LITERATURE_PARSER_BACKEND_PORT="8000"
LITERATURE_PARSER_BACKEND_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* black (formats your code);
* mypy (validates types);
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start a database.

I prefer doing it with docker:
```
```


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
